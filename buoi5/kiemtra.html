                Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. 
                The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of 
                Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins with:“Lorem ipsum dolor 
                sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua”. The 
                purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't 
                distract from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler text can be 
                very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.The passage experienced a surge in popularity 
                during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers 
                bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen all around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. 
                Use our generator to get your own, or read on for the authoritative history of lorem ipsum. Until recently, the 
                prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born as a nonsense text. “It's not Latin, though it looks like it, and it 
                actually says nothing,” Before & After magazine answered a curious reader, “Its ‘words’ loosely approximate the 
                frequency with which letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it looks pretty real”. As Cicero would put it, 
                “Um, not so fast”. The placeholder text, beginning with the line “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing 
                elit”, looks like Latin because in its youth, centuries ago, it was Latin. Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from 
                Hampden-Sydney College, is credited with discovering the source behind the ubiquitous filler text. In seeing a sample 
                of lorem ipsum, his interest was piqued by consectetur—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin dictionary 
                led McClintock to a passage from De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century 
                B.C. text from the Roman philosopher Cicero.
